  //Single Responsibility Principle: Each of the below methods perform a single responsibility: 
        //the first one only determines the number of generated customers based on the input weather condition
        //the second will only create a list of customers based on the input from previous method

 //Liskov's Principle Example Below: We used Liskov's principle throughout this project as you can 
        //exchange each specific item with the Item Class and the functionality will be the same and they all 
        //have the same property of name.
